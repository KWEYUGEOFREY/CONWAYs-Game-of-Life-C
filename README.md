# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by
Cambridge mathematician [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970.
It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply.
Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.




### The Rules


#### For a space that is 'populated':

 - Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
 - Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
 - Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.


#### For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'

 - Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
